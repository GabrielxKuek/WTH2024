# Paidion
TL;DR tamagotchi for child monitoring

Inspiration As a child, we often tend to avoid doing monotonous and boring things like doing the chores, listening to your parents or taking care of yourself. We wanted to create a way to automate monitoring your children's behaviours and encourage good habits in children.

This ultimately led to the inception of Paidion, automating child monitoring through the concept of gamification.

What it does Paidion is an interactive digital companion that helps children develop positive habits through engaging gameplay. Drawing inspiration from virtual pets, Paidion creates a meaningful connection between a child's daily responsibilities and their digital friend's wellbeing. Parents can customize daily tasks and goals through their dashboard, such as completing homework, brushing teeth, or helping with household chores.

When children successfully complete their assigned tasks, their digital companion thrives and grows stronger. Conversely, missing responsibilities affects their companion's health and happiness. To make the experience more social and motivating, children can interact with their friends' companions, fostering friendly competition and mutual encouragement. They can participate in cooperative activities or engage in friendly challenges, creating a supportive community of young users developing good habits together.

The parent dashboard, accessible across various devices, provides a comprehensive overview of their child's progress and allows for easy task management and monitoring of developing habits.

## WHY WE STAND OUT

    heavy focus on creating something that children will actually want to use
    focus on long-term benefits that will actually help children
    scalable product, with large amount of growth
    purpose-built device that provides a focused, distraction-free experience – unlike phones or tablets that can lead to other diversions, Paidion's dedicated console creates a special connection between child and digital pet while maintaining their attention on developing good habits

## How we built it

our hardware component uses esp32s3 dev module board with various components for input and output we have an parents' dashboard deployed through render

## Challenges we ran into

there were many problems here is a small list of only some of them!

    first time working with hardware
    didnt have all the hardware components we needed (had to adapt) for example, we didnt have any male to male jumper cables and had to create our own by dissecting the wires and joining them with electrical tape

# THEME + PROBLEM STATEMENT

## Everyday Automation

Artificial Intelligence (AI) has progressed leaps and bounds over the past few years, transforming the way we work and learn in classrooms. On the other hand, Internet of Things (IoT) technology has enhanced our awareness of the built environment around us on top of enabling new conveniences. How might we further harness these two technologies in our household and office buildings for monitoring, predicting failures, or reducing energy consumption? Teams may choose to use either Al or loT, or both.
TARGET AUDIENCE

parents with young children (especially working class parents have little time in the household to monitor their children)
